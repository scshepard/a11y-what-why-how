Talk for visit to Hyderabad, India,  entitled Designing Online Course Content for Universal Access. This presentation will introduce people to the “What?”, “Why?” and “How?” of web content accessibility highlighting the particular relevance and importance to online education. I will discuss international standards such as the WCAG 2.0, and techniques web developers use to meet them. Using real examples and a screen reader, I will demonstrate some of my own team's successes and pitfalls in our journey to make our course content accessible to everyone.
